# Deep_learning-simple_-ex-with-grad_desc-

In this file I am going to exaplain the calculation of slope and gradient descent approach for a deep learning network. 

To understand the idea, a simple example with one input (a uni-layer) and one output is taken. 

At the end: I will show that error can be reduced by the help of optimisation.
